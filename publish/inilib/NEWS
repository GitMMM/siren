1.0.7b3
-------

* Fixed dist tarball - the comment.ini file was not included

1.0.7b2
-------

* Use %g instead of %f for printing double precision numbers to
  ini files and when converting to strings, as suggested by bug
  #67302.


1.0.7b1
-------

* Added logic to ignore comments (starting with ;) when reading in
  an INI file.  Does not maintain comments on write (bug 677228)
* Fixed memory leak in INI::section::copy (bug 828881)
* Fixed some char* casting issues, where char* strings got cast to
  bool on assignment rather than std::strings (bug 497734)
* Fixed problem where datatype was lost when loading from file and
  using already-initialized defaults (bug 520448)
* Updated build process to be compatible with the latest versions of
  Automake and Autoconf


1.0.6
-----

* Fixed silly mistake in Debug.h.  There was a \ character as the last
  character in one of the comments, which was causing pain and
  suffering.
* Fixed another silly mistake in config/cxx_have_broken_getline.m4.
  I had a double ] at the end of the macro.
* Cleaned up ini_getline.h so that it wouldn't complain on LinuxPPC.
  I forgot that chars are unsigned on PPC.  Also short-circuited the
  code so that it was only included if needed (ie, on platforms where
  std::string::getline is broken()


1.0.5
-----

* Fixed bug with abort when value was blank.  Caused by error in
  crop() function
* Worked around a bug in the getline(fstream&, string&, charT) in some
  Sun Workshop 5.0 compilers.

-----

* Changed from section* and attribute* to section and attribute in the
  internal maps
* Removed abstract base class attribute and the idea of a wrap
  attribute

* Added operator overloading for attribute class to remove compiler
  problems
