inilib
======

inilib is a C++ library which provides a method of saving the
"state" of a program.  inilib provides a means of storing a number
of arbitrary settings in memory with an easy access interface, as well
providing means for saving the information to and loading it from
disk.  Data is stored in an easy to read format, allowing the user to
modify any of the information with a simple text editor.

inilib benefits the programmer by providing a simple, intuitive means
to store any data that can be expressed in std::string, int, double,
or bool types.  In addition, inilib handles any conversion that may be
necessary to convert from one type to the other.  Saving all
information stored in inilib to disk or loading information from disk
requires only one command.

Bug reports / suggestions / etc can be filed at the inilib SourceForge
page, http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/inilib/.  Please include the
inilib version number, which is contained in the VERSION file, which
is contained in the root directory of the distribution tarball.  If
the problem is related to the building of inilib, please include the
output from runing configure, as well as the errors in the build
process.
